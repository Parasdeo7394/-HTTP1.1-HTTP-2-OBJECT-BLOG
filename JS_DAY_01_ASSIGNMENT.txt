1) Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

        HTTP1.1                                       HTTP2
        
        i)Loads resource one after        i)Able to use a single TCP
          other, so if one resources       connection to send multiple
          cannot be loaded ,it block       streams of data at once so that
          all the resorces behind it.      no one resurce blocks any other resource.

        ii)req -> textual data            ii)req -> binary format

       iii)it will wait for the          iii)it can take multiple request at a
            server to  return a               time and respond with appropirate
            data and terminates                date for that req. 
            its connection.                    (Multiplexing)
     
       iv)he data will be given in       iv)binary format will be compressed.
          the compressed format

        v)quite slower when compared     v)it processes faster than HTTP 1
           to HTTP 2
   
        vi)Eg Search engine              vi)Eg Social media app

2)Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascrip

     Objects contains many value as key pair.In object have keys which is also treated
     as propety of object.It make our javasript code easier and more sustainable.
     Objects are important data types in javascript.Objects are different than primitive 
     datatypes(i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.).Primitive data types contain one value
     but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair.
    
   
     var Parasdreamplace = new Object();

     Parasdreamplace.land = 'Moon';

     Parasdreamplace.puchasing year = '2036';

     Parasdreamplace.how much = 'five hectare';
 
   

     After creating Parasdreamplace, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.

     i.e.

     Parasdreamplace.land

     Output: Moon
